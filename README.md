##Big update soon 

###Rootfs decrypting

To decrypt rootfs or other components like IMG3 files you have to grab keys from [iPhonewiki](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware_Keys). <br>

First, download the IPSW you choose to decrypt, you can download it directly from Decrypt0r or from ipsw.me. <br>
The program will ask you to add the keys grabed from iphonewiki before decrypting a file (only one for the rootfs). <br>

Specify the name of the file containing rootfs (ex 058-24465-023.dmg). <br>
In the IPSW file, there is three dmg files, rootfs is the biggest. <br>

Then the program is going to work automaticaly. <br>

If you want to modify rootfs (ex Setup.app) you can use TransMac for Windows. But it won't work to bypass iCloud <br>

### Encryption of rootfs and creating a Custom fimware

You can create a Custom fimware but it's crap. Be patient. <br>
Downgrades are already impossible without SHSHs blobs, on devices that do not have low level exploits (RIP Limera1n). <br>
Is this feature useless ? <br>
Yes, but it can still be used. <br>

###IMG3 and DFU file

To decrypt IMG3 files like `kernelcache` or `iBoot` just select 3 or 4 and follow the instructions
There are two DFU files : iBEC & iBSS. These extensions are **.dfu** but are concidered as IMG3 file. <br>


#Other components

To decrypt other firmware components like kernelcache or iBoot, you have to grab the keys from theiphonewiki <br>
The first one to add is the largest, and the second one is the iv key (the smallest).<br>

### How to build it?

To build Decrypt0r just cd to the decryptr0r directory and run `make + your_os` <br> 

If you need to build XPwn for Linux, just run `build.sh`.
OS X users you have to build XPwn yourself, I'll made a bin directory with all the binaries ASAP

## TODO

- One project for OS X, GNU/Linux & Windows
- Something... :) <br>
